- 🦋 More about me:
- Hey there,🌟 Did you know? I’m not just about pushing commits; I’m a multifaceted marvel! 🌱 As a part-time gardener at my own place, I help making the world breatheable for all. My fingers are nimble not just on the keyboard but also with crochet hooks, weaving patterns as complex as my code.

Languages? I speak four, not counting programming ones! 🗣️ And I was once the proud mom to four adorable kittens, my very own ‘cutie paws’ squad. 🐾

My love for animals doesn’t stop there; lazy pandas, friendly Horses, and loyal playful doggies are my top picks for the world’s cutest pet companions. 🐼🐴🐶 When I’m not debugging, you can find me whipping up culinary masterpieces—yes, I can cook! And when it comes to coding, it’s my kind of all-day, everyday passion project. 💻👩‍💻

Talking about goals?, My current goal is to make the GitHub Commit Bar green 🟢📌

So, that’s a byte-sized peek into my life. Now, let’s get back to merging our talents and creating something amazing together! Happy coding! 😄👨‍💻👩‍💻
